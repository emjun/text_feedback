Findings from this study could also help inform the way that files are organized on a computer and how software menus are designed on websites and other software.</p></div>

  <p class="page_section page_section_thumbs">Previous research in psychology suggests that cultural background affects the way people think [1]. There are two general ways of thinking: holistic or analytic. People who think holistically tend to group words based on their <emph>holistic function</emph> (i.e., Seagulls fly in the Sky). People who think analytically tend to group words based on <emph>analytic categories</emph> (i.e., Seagulls and Dogs are both animals). Holistic people also tend to group images based on more broadly shared <emph>thematic</emph> features (i.e., sharing a different feature with all other images) whereas analytic people tend to group images based on <emph>specific</emph> features (i.e., sharing one feature with all other images). People from Asia tend to think more holistically while people from Europe tend to think more analytically.</p>

  <!-- // Guiding Research Question or Hypothesis -->
  <br><div id='research_question'><h2 class='bolded-blue'>Why are we doing this research?</h2>
  <p class="page_section_thumbs">We think that there are finer grained differences between countries that were not possible to detect in the past. Previous research relied on lab studies, which are limited in the demographic diversity of people who participate. Large-scale online experiments are now easier to develop and can reach more diverse people. We hope to find not only how countries differ but also how demographic groups across countries may also be similar or different.</p></div>

  <!-- // Study Summary + Experimental Design -->
  <br><div id='experimental_design'><h2 class='bolded-blue'>How is the test designed?</h2>
  <p class="page_section page_section_thumbs">We measured your thinking style based on your verbal and visual grouping patterns. The activity where you had to pick among three words helps us measure how your language background may affect the way you group concepts presented verbally with words. The other activity where you had to pick the best group for an image measured how you visually categorize objects. By detecting your verbal and visual grouping tendencies, we can have a more complete grasp of the way you represent and categorize concepts in your mind.</p></div>
